                question: "What is beer and what are its basic raw materials?",
                answer: "Beer: product obtained by alcoholic fermentation (brewing) of beer wort using pure cultures of beer yeast (Saccharomyces), exceptionally by spontaneous fermentation.\nRaw materials:\n1. Malt (germinated and dried barley)\n2. Water (~90%)\n3. Yeast (converts sugars to alcohol + CO₂)\n4. Hops (Humulus lupulus — bitterness, aroma, antiseptic)",
                explanation: "Beer is the 5th most consumed drink in the world after tea, soft drinks, milk, and coffee."

                id: "m8ab66",
                question: "What is malting and what is malt?",
                answer: "Malting: conversion of barley into malt through soaking, germination, and drying.\nDuring germination, amylolytic and proteolytic enzymes are activated — they break down starch into fermentable sugars and proteins into amino acids.\nLight beers: malt dried at lower temperatures.\nDark beers: malt dried at higher temperatures.",
                explanation: "Wheat, rye, and millet can also be malted, but barley is the primary cereal."

                id: "rdliwz",
                question: "What is mashing and what is wort?",
                answer: "Mashing: mixing milled grains (malt) with hot water. Enzymes (α-amylase and β-amylase) break down starch into sugars (mainly maltose). Takes 1-2 hours.\nTwo methods:\n• Infusion mashing: gradual heating in one vessel → more fermentable sugars → highly brewed beer (top-fermented/ale)\n• Decoction mashing: part boiled and returned → more unfermentable extract (dextrin) → lower brewed beer (bottom-fermented/lager)\nWort: the sweet liquid obtained from mashing.",
                explanation: "After mashing, wort is boiled with hops for about 1 hour."

                id: "62fgyx",
                question: "What are the three roles of hops in beer production?",
                answer: "1. Provides ingredients for bitterness and hoppy aroma\n2. Has antiseptic effect (preservative)\n3. Promotes protein coagulation (clarification)\nHops are the virgin unfertilized flowers of Humulus lupulus.",
                explanation: "Hops are added during wort boiling."

                id: "rvb7k1",
                question: "What are the four steps of beer production?",
                answer: "1. Malt production: cleaning, soaking, germination, drying of barley\n2. Wort production: milling malt, mashing, boiling with hops\n3. Fermentation: primary (wort → young beer with alcohol + CO₂) + secondary (conditioning/maturation — yeast settles, beer clears, flavours balance)\n4. Processing and packaging: clarification, stabilization, pasteurization, filling",
                explanation: "Fermentation may take one week to several months depending on beer style."

                question: "What is the difference between lager and ale?",
                answer: "Lager (bottom-fermented):\n• Yeast: Saccharomyces uvarum\n• Starts at 9-18°C, ends at 6-8°C\n• Long secondary fermentation at 0-10°C (lagering)\n• Full flavour, pronounced bitterness, thick foam\n• Most European beers\n\nAle (top-fermented):\n• Yeast: Saccharomyces cerevisiae\n• Starts at 10°C, ends at 25°C (warm brewing)\n• Yeast floats to surface\n• Slightly fruity (apple, pear, banana)\n• Shorter maturation at 20°C",
                explanation: "Stout is a special ale: dark, uses roasted malt/barley, nitrogen for dense foam."

                question: "What are the two essential processes for making spirits, and what does each do?",
                answer: "1. Fermentation: where ALL the alcohol is created (yeast + sugar → alcohol + CO₂).\n2. Distillation: where the alcohol is concentrated.\nDistillation works because ethanol boils at a lower temperature than water — when heated, ethanol evaporates in higher concentration in the steam, which is condensed and collected.\nMost distilleries use copper stills (copper reacts with sulfur by-products → cleaner, more aromatic spirit).",
                explanation: "One-step distillation gives a product of approximately 25-35% alcohol."

                id: "wqznb3",
                question: "What alcohol concentrations result from the two-step distillation process?",
                answer: "First distillation: the still is filled 50-75% with mash/wine; ethanol concentrates and solids separate → spirit of 20-50 vol% alcohol.\nSecond distillation (rectification): the still is filled to 2/3 with the first distillate; ethanol and desirable substances concentrate further, undesirable substances removed → spirit of 60-70 vol% alcohol.",
                explanation: "Rectification (redistillation) was introduced in the 19th century for greater purity."

                answer: "Cooling: optimal storage -1 to 2°C. In the depth of the meat: beef/pig/sheep <7°C, poultry <4°C, offal <3°C.\nFreezing: internal temperature drops below -12°C. Shelf life: 12 months at -18°C; relative humidity 95-100%; freezing mass loss 1.0-1.5%.\nQuick freezing = small crystals = less tissue damage (better). Slow freezing = large crystals = damage and more drip loss.",

                question: "What is an egg and which types are consumed?",
                answer: "An egg is a complex reproductive cell whose structure and composition support the development of new life — sometimes described as an 'organism in miniature'.\nFresh chicken eggs are the most commonly consumed. Eggs may also come from goose, turkey, duck, quail, or ostrich.\nPackaging must indicate the type of poultry the eggs originate from.",
                explanation: "World egg production is ~83.4 million tons; Asia leads with ~51.9 million tons."

                question: "What is the anatomy of an egg?",
                answer: "• Shell: porous, made of calcium carbonate\n• Skin (membrane): on the surface, protects against bacteria\n• Airspace: space between two membranes\n• Egg white (albumen): two layers — thick and thin\n• Chalaza: keeps the yolk in the middle\n• Yolk + yolk membrane: yellow, dark and light parts",
                explanation: "The chalazae are the twisted strands that hold the yolk centered within the white."

                answer: "• Densitometry: immersion in a 12% salt solution (fresh eggs sink; stale eggs float due to a larger air chamber)\n• Candling: examination using an ovoscope (a light source revealing the interior)",
                explanation: "As an egg ages, its air chamber grows, so it becomes more buoyant in salt water."

                answer: "Storage: eggs are mainly consumed fresh; the sale period must not exceed 21 days after laying (summer ~10 days, winter ~21 days). Eggs easily absorb foreign odours — don't store with strong-smelling foods.\nEgg products: liquid chilled, frozen liquid, dried, and boiled egg products.",
                explanation: "Because eggs readily pick up odours, they should be stored away from pungent foods."

                question: "What is a healthy diet and what are its three principles?",
                answer: "A healthy (balanced) diet provides an adequate intake and ratio of macronutrients meeting energy and physiological needs (without excess), with sufficient micronutrients and fluids.\nPrinciples:\n1. Variety: combining food groups for nutritional synergy (legumes + cereals; non-heme iron + vitamin C)\n2. Moderation: of fats, added sugar, salt, alcohol, energy\n3. Balance: 85% nutrient-dense foods : 15% 'discretionary calories'",
                explanation: "Nutritional synergy means combining foods so nutrients enhance each other (e.g., vitamin C boosts non-heme iron absorption)."

Thermic effect of food (TEF): energy used to digest food — on average ~10% (highest for protein 15-30%, carbs 5-8%, fats 2-3%).\n3. Thermic effect of physical activity: the most variable component (100-3000 kcal/day) — 10-35% of total.",

Beef accounts for ~36% of US food-related GHG emissions; one pound of lamb generates ~5× the GHG of chicken and ~30× of lentils.",
