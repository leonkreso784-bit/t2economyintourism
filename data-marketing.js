                <h3>1) Why Marketing Became a Core Business Logic</h3>
                <p>In modern competition, firms no longer win only with production capacity. They win by understanding who the customer is, what problem they solve, and why the offering is superior to alternatives.</p>

                <h3>2) Evolution of Business Concepts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Production concept:</strong> make efficiently and lower costs</li>
                    <li><strong>Selling concept:</strong> push existing products via promotion</li>
                    <li><strong>Marketing concept:</strong> start from customer needs and wants</li>
                    <li><strong>Relationship/Holistic:</strong> manage networks and integrated value creation</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="formula-box">
                    <p><strong>Marketing concept:</strong> Understand needs -> design value -> deliver better than competition</p>
                </div>

                <h3>3) Strategic Meaning of Marketing Concept</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer value is defined before product design</li>
                    <li>Competitive advantage comes from better fit, not only lower price</li>
                    <li>Profit is achieved by satisfying target customers efficiently</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4) Marketing Mix as Execution System</h3>
                <p>Strategy is implemented through the marketing mix: <strong>product, price, distribution, promotion</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Product defines utility and differentiation</li>
                    <li>Price defines value-for-money perception</li>
                    <li>Distribution defines accessibility and convenience</li>
                    <li>Promotion defines communication and persuasion</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5) Relationship and Holistic Marketing</h3>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <p><strong>Relationship marketing:</strong> include suppliers, distributors, and consumers as partners in value delivery.</p>
                    <p><strong>Holistic marketing:</strong> all business functions influence market outcomes.</p>

                <p>A market is the space where value exchange occurs through offers, demand, and transactions.</p>

                <h3>2) Value Exchange Logic</h3>
                <p>Markets work when both sides perceive value and can complete exchange under acceptable conditions.</p>

                <h4>Conditions for Exchange</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Two or more parties</li>
                    <li>Each side has something of value</li>
                    <li>Communication and delivery are possible</li>
                    <li>Acceptance/rejection is free</li>
                    <li>Exchange is desirable for both parties</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3) Why Discrepancies Exist</h3>
                <div class="warning-box">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Core Issue</h4>
                    <p>Producer logic and buyer logic often differ. Marketing exists to reconcile these differences.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>Main Discrepancy Types</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spatial</li>
                    <li>Temporal</li>
                    <li>Information</li>
                    <li>Value perception</li>
                    <li>Ownership</li>
                    <li>Quantity and assortment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4) Utility Creation for Market Participants</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Form utility:</strong> transforming input into useful offer</li>
                    <li><strong>Place utility:</strong> making offer available where needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Time utility:</strong> making offer available when needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Possession utility:</strong> enabling ownership/use transfer</li>
                </ul>
