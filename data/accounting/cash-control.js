            <h4>💰 What is Cash?</h4>
            <p>In accounting, <strong>cash</strong> refers to the most liquid assets that are readily available for use. Cash includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currency and coins on hand</li>
                <li>Bank deposits (checking and savings accounts)</li>
                <li>Checks received from customers</li>
                <li>Money orders and traveler's checks</li>
                <li>Other negotiable instruments</li>
                <li>Undeposited cash receipts</li>
                <li>Cash in house banks (front desk, restaurants, bars)</li>
            </ul>

                <h4>⚠️ NOT Cash:</h4>

                <strong>2. Ensure Accuracy</strong> - Maintain reliable and accurate accounting records<br><br>
                <strong>3. Promote Efficiency</strong> - Encourage operational effectiveness<br><br>

            </div>
            
            <p>The <strong>Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO)</strong> framework is the gold standard for internal control. It has <strong>5 interrelated components</strong>:</p>
            
            <div class="formula-box">
                <strong>5 Components of COSO Framework:</strong><br><br>
                <strong>1. Control Environment</strong><br>
                The "tone at the top" - management's integrity, ethical values, and commitment to competence<br><br>
                
                <strong>2. Risk Assessment</strong><br>
                Identifying and analyzing risks that may prevent achieving objectives<br><br>
                
                <strong>3. Control Activities</strong><br>
                Policies and procedures that ensure management directives are carried out (approvals, authorizations, verifications, reconciliations)<br><br>
                
                <strong>4. Information & Communication</strong><br>
                Relevant information must be identified, captured, and communicated in a timely manner<br><br>
                
                <strong>5. Monitoring Activities</strong><br>
                Ongoing evaluations to assess whether controls are functioning effectively

            <hr>
            
            <h4>🔐 Key Control Principles</h4>
            
            <h5>Separation of Duties</h5>
            <p>The most critical internal control principle. <strong>No single person</strong> should control all aspects of a transaction. Three functions must be separated:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authorization</strong> - Approving transactions</li>
                <li><strong>Custody</strong> - Physical control of assets</li>
                <li><strong>Record Keeping</strong> - Recording transactions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example-box">
                <h4>📝 Example: Hotel Front Desk</h4>
                <p>• Night auditor (records) ≠ Cashier (custody) ≠ Manager (authorization)</p>
                <p>• If one person does all three, they could steal cash and cover it up in records!</p>
            </div>
            
            <h5>Prenumbered Documents</h5>
            <p>All important documents (checks, invoices, receipts) should have sequential numbers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Track all transactions</li>
                <li>Detect missing or duplicate documents</li>
                <li>Establish an audit trail</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Bonding Employees</h5>
            <p>Fidelity bonds provide insurance against employee dishonesty. Benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial recovery if theft occurs</li>
                <li>Deterrent effect - employees know losses can be recovered</li>
                <li>Background checks during bonding process</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h5>Surprise Audits</h5>
            <p>Unannounced examinations of cash and records. The unpredictability is the key - employees never know when an audit might occur.</p>
            
            <hr>
            
            <h4>🏨 House Banks in Hospitality</h4>
            <p>A <strong>house bank</strong> is a fixed amount of cash assigned to a cashier for making change. Controls include:</p>
